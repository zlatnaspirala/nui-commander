# nui-commander #
 I will use motion detect on video stream to create and control UI Menu system with progress bar control, actions-events, popup or creating dom element or canvas staff.  Interface must be drawn on video tag in `AR` manner. Point is to create total manipulation only with your hands in the air.

### From project demo example:

### Nui-commander used like submodules in
### https://github.com/zlatnaspirala/vue-typescript-starter

 DOM elements are on whole document size and indicate at the moment .
 On canvas indicator table blocks canvas object will accumulate movement action and after some little period on
 idle it ill fall to the opacity `0`. This is just example of usage!
